# Connect Apps to LINE

You can add functionality to your app that allows your users to login with LINE.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting your Auth0 app to LINE, you will need to have an account on [LINE](https://developers.line.biz/console/register/line-login/channel/).

## Steps

To connect your app to LINE, you will:

1. [Set up your app in LINE](#set-up-your-app-in-line)
2. [Create and enable a connection in Auth0](#create-and-enable-a-connection-in-auth0)
3. [Test the connection](#test-the-connection)

### Set up your app in LINE

Follow the instructions in the [Getting started with LINE Login](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/getting-started/).

While setting up the channel in LINE for your app, make sure you save the **Channel ID** and the **Channel Secret**.

### Create and enable a connection in Auth0

[Set up the Bitbucket social connection](/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-social) in Auth0. Make sure you have the **API key** and the **API secret key** generated.
